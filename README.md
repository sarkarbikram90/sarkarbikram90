- 👋 Hi, I’m Bikram and I have 10 years of experience and out of which 4 years in IT operations, applications, and infrastructure monitoring to ensure the reliability, and performance of critical systems and services. As part of my day-to-day job role, I monitor various on-prem and cloud resources, such as Linux/Windows clusters, DB clusters, network interfaces, switches, routers, autosys batch jobs, etc using tools such as Network Node Manager, LogicMonitor, ESP Monitor, Grafana. I monitor Go, Java, and Kafka-based applications as well and report any anomalies to IT stakeholders. Additionally, I draft technical documentation, and SOPs, attend daily, weekly, and monthly client calls to deliver reports, and coordinate with onsite teams to refine processes. I am passionate about delivering high-quality solutions and improving customer satisfaction. To augment my proficiency, I've proactively upskilled myself in a range of cutting-edge technologies, including Google Cloud, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Golang.
