I am a passionate IT Operations, Infrastructure and Automation Engineer with expertise in DevOps practices, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform, and hands-on development experience in Python and Go. My professional journey has equipped me with robust skills in building, scaling, and automating cloud-native environments.

Software engineering specially scalable and distributed systems always fascinates me, and I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore new technologies. 

Lately, I have been focusing on Machine Learning—learning how to develop ML models and bring them to production. I am particularly keen on the intersection of AI/ML with large-scale infrastructure and automation.

I am always eager to connect with other passionate engineers and tech enthusiasts. Let’s keep learning and building the future of software together!
